# DOWY - Local YouTube Downloader for PowerShell

IMPORTANT: When pasting the YouTube link, there mustn't be any `&` characters. PowerShell treats them as separators between commands. This would result in two commands and break the arguments system. To counter this, use quotation marks `' '` or `" "` It is worth noting, that YouTube doesn't have this character in the identifier, TODO.
